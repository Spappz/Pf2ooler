# Changelog

## 1.9.0 _All Spruced Up_ edition
- Add `/lookup creature summary` command, which shows a summary (wow!) of the creature's statblock. *Note:* This command will be superseded by `/lookup creature statblock`, once it's ready, and its current function will change to fill a new niche.
- Split out `/lookup` commands' "!random" option into their own `/random` commands (warned you!)
- Fixed 'Amp' text not appearing on psychic spells
- Fixed 'Duration' text on rituals sometimes not rendering properly
- Improved action emojis (no more squished-up 3-action symbol!)
- Started copying specifically relevant Pf2eTools changelog entries into the Pf2ooler changelog (for people that follow Pf2ooler but not Pf2eTools)
- (Pf2eTools) Added missing creature images for converted sources
- (Typos)
