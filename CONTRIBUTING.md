~~I am currently not seeking contribution. This will likely change at a later date. Watch this space!~~

Pf2ooler development has effectively stalled while the new version of [Pf2ools](https://github.com/Pf2ools) is being developed, due to their interconnectedness. Once the latter is in a beta stage, I plan to rebuild most of Pf2ooler from the ground-up in an open, contributable way. This will include richer and more resilient formatting, in-line links, interactive buttons, and more! So, although this is still just a 'watch this space', you can now watch _that_ space too if you're interested.

Contributions to [Pf2ools](https://github.com/Pf2ools)—particularly in data-entry (which anyone can learn with ease)—is always appreciated.
